# Multi Database Solution for Pandemic Airport Operations


## Introduction
The Pandemic Airport Operations project is a multi-database solution designed to improve airport safety and efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The solution integrates data from multiple sources and databases to provide a comprehensive view of passenger health status, travel history, and compliance with health guidelines.

## Technologies
The solution is built using the following technologies:

* Cloud computing platforms (such as AWS or Microsoft Azure)
* Databases (such as Dynamo DB, Mongo DB, and Neo4j)
* Programming languages (such as JavaScript, Python, and SQL)
* APIs (to integrate data from various sources)
* Data visualization tools (such as Tableau or Power BI)
* Project management tools (such as Jira or Trello)
* Data security tools (to ensure the protection of sensitive passenger data)
* Data analytics tools (such as R or Python libraries)

## Installation
To install the solution, you will need access to cloud computing platforms such as AWS or Microsoft Azure. You will also need to install and configure the necessary databases, programming languages, APIs, and other tools required for the solution.

## Usage
The solution can be used by airport authorities and health officials to monitor passenger movements and health indicators, identify potential health risks, facilitate contact tracing, and improve quarantine and testing protocols. The data stored in the solution can also be used for predictive modeling and machine learning to inform real-time decision making.
